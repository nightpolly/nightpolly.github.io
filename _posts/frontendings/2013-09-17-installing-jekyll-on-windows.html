  <p class="lede">The goal here is to get Jekyll installed on a Windows machine, and have the option to use Pygments within it (for syntax highlighting). These are actually my own notes, which I took while going through the process. This is a guide for complete beginners. The only thing you need to know is where to find your cmd.exe.</p>

  <h2>Intro</h2>

  <p>…or just <a href="#meat-n-potatoes">skip to the juicy stuff</a>.</p>

  <p>I decided to put this on the Internet because there aren’t as many tutorials for Windows on that subject, as there are for Mac. That’s not to say there aren’t <em>any</em> though—below is a small list of such tutorials, you can check them out as well.</p>

  <h3>What is Jekyll? What do we use Pygments for?</h3>

  <p>Jekyll is a static site generator. It basically takes your Markdown, Textile, or HTML files as content, CSS as layout, and transforms them into a static website. It’s really easy to use, and it also has <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/">extensive documentation</a>.</p>

  <p>Among other useful things, Jekyll also provides you with a simple way to publish code snippets on your website. To make the code pretty, it utilizes Pygments—a syntax highlighter written in Python. You can read more about what it does and see some demos on <a href="http://pygments.org/">Pygments’ website</a>.</p>

  <h3>Ruby</h3>

  <p>To check whether you already have Ruby on your computer (not very likely on a Windows), open cmd.exe and type:</p>

{% highlight console %}ruby -v{% endhighlight %}

  <p>When you hit Enter, it will either tell you what version of Ruby you’re running, or that it doesn’t know what you’re talking about.</p>

  <p>To get Ruby, <a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/">download RubyInstaller</a>. I got <em>Ruby 2.0.0-p247 (x64)</em> which, at the time of writing, was the latest version for a 64-bit Windows.</p>

  <p>From that same page, under <em>Other Useful Downloads</em>, get also Ruby Development Kit (see on the right which one corresponds to your version of Ruby).</p>

  <p>Run the RubyInstaller executable. At some point you’ll be presented with a few choices: installation destination (make it something like <b>C:\Ruby</b>), and three options. The first is not required for what we’re doing here, but select the other two:</p>

    <img class="figure__content" src="/frontendings/img/ruby-installation-options.png" alt="">

  </figure>

  <h3>Development Kit</h3>

  <p>After the Ruby installation is complete, create a directory <b>C:\RubyDevKit</b> and run the second file you downloaded. When prompted where to extract the files, give that folder as a destination.</p>

  <p>Open that folder you just created. Shift + right-click inside it and choose the option <em>Open command window here</em>. cmd.exe should appear.</p>

  <p class="note">As far as I know, this shift + right-click thing is not available on Windows versions prior to Vista. If you want to use it on XP, check out Microsoft’s <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/xp-downloads#2TC=powertoys">separate tool</a>, called Open Command Window Here. Alternatively, you can just change directory in cmd.exe by typing:</p>

{% highlight console %}cd C:\RubyDevKit{% endhighlight %}

  <p>Now that you’re in that folder, type:</p>

{% highlight console %}ruby dk.rb init{% endhighlight %}

  <p>and hit Enter. A message should inform you that the initialization is complete.</p>

  <p>Now there’s a generated file called <em>config.yml</em> in your RubyDevKit folder. Open that file in your code editor. You’ll see a comment in the file, explaining what you have to do: Add one last line at the bottom to tell Development Kit where Ruby is:</p>

{% highlight yaml %}
# This configuration file contains the absolute path locations of all
# installed Rubies to be enhanced to work with the DevKit. This config
# file is generated by the 'ruby dk.rb init' step and may be modified
# before running the 'ruby dk.rb install' step. To include any installed
# Rubies that were not automagically discovered, simply add a line below
# the triple hyphens with the absolute path to the Ruby root directory.
#
# Example:
#
# ---
# - C:/ruby19trunk
# - C:/ruby192dev
#
---
- C:/Ruby
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>Save the file, go back to cmd.exe and type:</p>

{% highlight console %}ruby dk.rb install{% endhighlight %}

  <h3>Jekyll</h3>

  <p>Now you have both Ruby and Development Kit, so you can install Jekyll. Which is as simple as:</p>

{% highlight console %}gem install jekyll{% endhighlight %}

  <p>As of <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/history/">version 0.12.0</a> Jekyll uses <a href="https://github.com/tmm1/pygments.rb">pygments.rb</a> as a replacement for <a href="https://github.com/github/albino">the Albino gem</a> for the syntax highlighting. In order for pygments.rb to work, you need a 2.x version of Python.</p>

  <p>So <a href="http://www.python.org/getit/">download Python</a> (I got version 2.7.5) and install it in destination such as <strong>C:\Python27</strong>.</p>

  <p>Right-click on My Computer, select Properties. In the window that opens, select Advanced system settings (on the left). Then click the Environment Variables at the bottom of the next window. Then, under System variables, find the variable Path. Select it, click Edit, and add the paths to your Python installation.</p>

    <img class="figure__content" src="/frontendings/img/windows-is-hard.png" alt="">
    <figcaption class="figure__caption">Fig. 2: <strong>Windows is hard</strong>.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>You need to add <strong>C:\Python27;</strong> and <strong>C:\Python27\Scripts;</strong> where <strong>C:\Python27</strong> is the directory of your Python installation.</p>

  <h3>Python Distribute &amp; Pygments</h3>

  <p>Download Python’s bootstrap Distribute installation <a href="http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py">here</a>. Open cmd.exe in the directory of that file and type:</p>

{% highlight console %}python distribute_setup.py{% endhighlight %}

  <p>After that one is done, install Pygments:</p>

{% highlight console %}easy_install Pygments{% endhighlight %}

  <h3>pygments.rb</h3>

  <p>Check what version of <em>pygments.rb</em> you have. You can find it in <strong>C:\Ruby\lib\ruby\gems\2.0.0\gems</strong> (adjust for your own Ruby directory). At the time of writing, cmd.exe showed errors with both 0.5.1 and 0.5.2 versions. So if yours is one of those, you might want to switch to 0.5.0, which seems to work just fine. Here’s how to do that:</p>

{% highlight console %}
gem uninstall pygments.rb -v "=0.5.2"
gem install pygments.rb -v "=0.5.0"
{% endhighlight %}

  <h2>Test it</h2>

  <p>If you want to test if everything is working as expected, create a sample Jekyll site. If you are yet to learn how to use Jekyll, no worries—for this test at least Jekyll will pretty much do all of the hard work. Also, don’t go buying hosting services just yet. You can use Jekyll locally and preview your site in localhost.</p>

  <p>Make a folder, say <strong>D:\jekyll-test</strong>. Open cmd.exe in that folder and tell Jekyll to create your new site:</p>

{% highlight console %}jekyll new my-new-site{% endhighlight %}

  <p>cmd.exe will tell you something along the lines of “high five, human” and inside your test folder you’ll find a new one, called <strong>my-new-site</strong>.</p>

  <p>Then change directory to that folder, and start the development server:</p>

{% highlight console %}
cd D:\jekyll-test\my-new-site
jekyll serve -w
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>The <code>-w</code> part above (or <code>--watch</code>) means that Jekyll is going to monitor your files for changes and update the generated site if it finds something new.</p>

  <p>More high-fives, and you can see your site at <a href="http://localhost:4000/">localhost:4000</a>. Conveniently, in that demo you have some sample code, so you can see the syntax highlighting in action.</p>

  <p class="note">Check out the <em>_config.yml</em> file in <strong>my-new-site</strong>. This is your site’s configuration file. You can see the defaults in <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/">Jekyll’s documentation</a>.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>

  <p>I hope your test was successful! There’s much more to learn about Jekyll than those few commands. I myself just started playing with it, and it seems pretty neat. Also, Github Pages are powered by it, so you can host your website on Github for free.</p>
