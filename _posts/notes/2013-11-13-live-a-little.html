  <p>I spend a large amount of my free time in front of a screen, and I often have a hard time explaining to people why that is. Or rather, why it appeals to me, even though it may not appeal to them. I get reactions like <q>You should get out more,</q> or <q>Have some fun once in a while,</q> or even the occasional <q>Technology is evil and corrupts our children.</q></p>
  <p>To each his own, I guess, though it’s a little different with friends. It’s harder to argue with people who genuinely believe they’re helping. But forcing your own values on someone is still an act of a close-minded idiot, even if you do have the best of intentions.</p>
  <p>Let me clarify something here—I <em>do</em> go out. I’ll run/climb/bike through any place that looks even remotely interesting. I’ll go anywhere and do anything, if I can afford it. I’m not denying the importance of new experiences that challenge your way of thinking.</p>
  <p>But how is sitting in front of the computer <em>not</em> one of those experiences, and in what way does it rob you of them? Granted, the Internet is full of dumb stuff, but if you’re going to waste your time, being on top of a mountain won’t help you. If I spend a Friday night tinkering with code, or learning new words in a foreign language, or watching lectures from years ago, does that mean I didn’t “live” somehow?</p>
  <blockquote class="post_quote">
    <p>No amount of jet skiing or bungee jumping or whatever could be as deep down fun and satisfying as learning something new that changes how I see the world […] and then helps me make something new that contributes back to the world.</p>

  <p>Mr. Sivers and I have both decided that creating stuff makes us better human beings. But that’s a personal thing, an opinion as valid as any other. So as much as I love answering the question <q>Why do you sit on your desk so much</q> with <q>Why don’t you sit on your desk more,</q> I think I’ll just print that quote and keep it in my pocket.</p>
