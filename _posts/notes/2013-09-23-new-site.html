<div class="post_entry addair">
  <p>This is a place to poke at code and screw up things. One poke-worthy thing I keep hearing about is Jekyll, so I’m giving it a try. This also gave me <a href="/frontendings/installing-jekyll-on-windows">something to write about</a>, so I can play with typography and colors.</p>
  <p>I thought it would be a good idea to separate the whole website into two main categories—one for general stuff, and another for front-end stuff (that’s what I do).</p>
  <p>In case you’re reading this soon after I post it, bear in mind that I’m making it up as I go along. Hell, I haven’t even tested the thing yet.</p>
