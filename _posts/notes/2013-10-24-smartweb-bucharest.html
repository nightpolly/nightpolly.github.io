  <p class="post_lede post_block">Exactly a month ago I attended my very first front-end conference. This post is awfully late.</p>
  <p class="post_note">If you want to see a brilliantly deductive summary of the talks, read <cite><a href="http://sickdesigner.com/smartweb/">The SmartWeb Jellyfish Highjack</a></cite> by Radu Chelariu, who was one of the speakers.</p>
  <p>SmartWeb was a big deal for me—not only because I wanted to see what a conference is like (TEDx events don’t count), but because we don’t have many of those in this corner of the continent. I really didn’t need convincing. Still, the <a href="http://www.smartwebconf.com/speakers/" title="SmartWeb’s line-up">list of speakers</a> made a pretty good case.</p>
  <p>I live in Bulgaria, but close to the Romanian border. So I decided I’ll make the two-hour drive to Bucharest early in the morning, leave the car somewhere for the day, and get back home in the evening.</p>
  <p>In Bucharest, after losing a game of “who knows the city better” to the GPS, I found the venue. It was still early for the talks, so I spent some time watching the last preparations and checking Twitter. I saw a few of the speakers—some talking to attendees, some busy with their laptops, Carl Smith jumping in place…</p>
  <p>Crowds are not really my thing, so even though the folks there seemed very nice, I felt super self-conscious the whole time. I’m one of those people who always sit in the back and listen, then sneak away unnoticed. Now I regret not talking to more of those guys and girls, but at the time I felt way out of my comfort zone.</p>
  <p>My social awkwardness aside, the atmosphere was amazing. I remember thinking how all these people look like they know each other, like they <em>belong</em> there. Which made me realize that, until now, I’ve been doubting the existence of a web community in Eastern Europe. I knew there are some talented designers and developers here, but always assumed it’s just a handful of people… Very ignorant on my part. I should’ve been paying more attention.</p>
  <p>A quick note about the sexism in the industry: I know it exists, and I was more that worried about that when I left for SmartWeb. I saw <strong>none of it</strong> there. Yes, most of the attendees and all of the speakers were men, and it so didn’t matter.</p>
  <p>After the talks I went for a bite with a few friends who live in Bucharest. They saw me off to the after-party, which was a lot less crowded and I finally managed to relax a little. That and a few beers did it for my sleep-deprived brain, so unfortunately I couldn’t stay as long as I wanted. I did get some hugs before I left though.</p>
