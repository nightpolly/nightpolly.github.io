      <p class="subtitle M3-up">Let’s pretend it’s a real website</p>
      <p>Suspension of disbelief or willing suspensio<mark class="ch45-75">n of disbelief is a term coined</mark> in 1817 by the poet and aesthetic philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who suggested that if a writer could infuse a human interest and a semblance of truth into a fantastic tale, the reader would suspend judgment concerning the implausibility of the narrative.</p>
      <p>Suspension of disbelief often applies to fic<mark class="ch45-75">tional works of the action, com</mark>edy, fantasy, and horror genres. <strong>Cognitive estrangement</strong> in fiction involves using a person’s ignorance or lack of knowledge to promote suspension of disbelief.</p>
      <h3 class="M3-up">In popular culture</h3>
      <p>According to the theory, suspension of disbe<mark class="ch45-75">lief is an essential ingredient</mark> for any kind of storytelling. With any film, the viewer has to ignore the reality that they are viewing a two-dimensional moving image on a screen and temporarily accept it as reality in order to be entertained.</p>
      <h4 class="m3-up">Animations and comics</h4>
      <p>One arguing from the theory of suspension of<mark class="ch45-75"> disbelief would contend that w</mark>hile Superman's abilities and vulnerabilities are the foundational premises the audience accepted as their part of the initial deal; they did not accept a persistent inability for otherwise normal characters to recognize a close colleague solely because of minor changes in clothing.</p>
      <h4 class="m3-up">Video games</h4>
      <p>Video games are also said to require suspens<mark class="ch45-75">ion of disbelief. Often realism</mark> is compromised even in games that set out to be realistic, either intentionally to not overly complicate game mechanics or due to technical limitations.</p>
      <p>Some games based on <cite>Spider-Man </cite>have the comi<mark class="ch45-75">c hero swinging around a city w</mark>ith his webs sticking to nothing but the sky.</p>
      <h3 class="M3-up">Use in psychology</h3>
      <p>Suspension of disbelief has also been used w<mark class="ch45-75">ithin a mental health context b</mark>y Frank DeFulgentis in his book <cite>Flux</cite>. It is an attempt to describe the phenomenon of forgetting irrational thoughts associated with cases of OCD. In the book, the author suggests <q>suspending disbelief</q> as opposed to forcing ourselves to forget; similar to how one would put a virus in quarantine.</p>

        <h3 class="m2-up">A few notes</h3>
        <p>The marked text above shows characters 45 to 75 in each paragraph. Generally it’s a good idea to keep your line lengths about that size.</p>
